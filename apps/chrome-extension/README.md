   cd onpoint/apps/chrome-extension
   ```

2. **Load Extension in Chrome**

### Configure Origin Trial Tokens via .env (optional)

If you need Origin Trial tokens (e.g., Writer/Rewriter/Proofreader APIs, or Prompt on Chrome 131‚Äì136), manage them through a local `.env` file.

1. Create `.env` next to `manifest.json` using the template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and paste your token strings
   ```

2. Supported variables (paste full token strings):
   - `OT_WRITER_TOKEN` ‚Äî Chrome Extensions token
   - `OT_REWRITER_TOKEN` ‚Äî Chrome Extensions token
   - `OT_PROOFREADER_TOKEN` ‚Äî Chrome Extensions token
   - `OT_PROMPT_TOKEN` ‚Äî Chrome Extensions token (only for Chrome 131‚Äì136)
   - `OT_EXTRA_TOKENS` ‚Äî optional, comma-separated list for rotations

3. Inject tokens into `manifest.json`:
   ```bash
   npm run inject-ot
   # or as part of build
   npm run build
   ```

This keeps tokens out of version control and writes them into `manifest.json` under `trial_tokens`. Page-origin tokens (Third‚Äëparty matching) can be saved directly in the popup Diagnostics and are injected by the content script.
