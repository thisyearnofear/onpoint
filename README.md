## 🛠️ Core Principles

1. **ENHANCEMENT FIRST**: Always prioritize enhancing existing components over creating new ones
2. **AGGRESSIVE CONSOLIDATION**: Delete unnecessary code rather than deprecating
3. **PREVENT BLOAT**: Systematically audit and consolidate before adding new features
4. **DRY**: Single source of truth for all shared logic
5. **CLEAN**: Clear separation of concerns with explicit dependencies
6. **MODULAR**: Composable, testable, independent modules
7. **PERFORMANT**: Adaptive loading, caching, and resource optimization
8. **ORGANIZED**: Predictable file structure with domain-driven design
