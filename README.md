# OnPoint Fashion AI Platform

**AI-powered fashion discovery platform with virtual try-on and digital ownership.**

OnPoint combines AI design generation, AR virtual try-on, blockchain asset ownership, and privacy-preserving identity to create a comprehensive fashion technology solution.

## 🚀 Quick Start

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/thisyearnofear/onpoint.git
cd onpoint
pnpm install

# Start development
pnpm dev
# → Web app: http://localhost:3000
```

## 🛠️ Environment Variables

To run the application, you need to set up the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# AI Provider Keys (at least one required)
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# WalletConnect Project ID (required for wallet connections)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id_here

You can copy the `.env.example` file to create your `.env.local`:
